# Listen2See_Backend
A light application's backend for hearing disabled person

---

In this project, we have used following technology:

	1. flask
	2. websocket
	3. google speech recoginition
	4. microsoft speeker recoginition

We are trying to help people to record sound in a much more efficient way. For example, we can record course or meetings automatically. And might get some key points. And for hearing disable people, we can provide a way to help them recoginize the sound matters to there life by see the mobile-phone. For example, when a hearing disable person are on the subway, he might be very nervous for the high chance to miss the station. And we can select the key point from mass data and remind him by a smart watch .
